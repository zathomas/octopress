Continuous Delivery, by Jez Humble and David Farley, is one of the best
software engineering books I've ever read. The ideas in this book are
going to transform the industry.

The general idea is that deployments and upgrades are only as painful as
they are because we do them infrequently. The release process should be
so routine that performing a release is the most boring thing in the
world. Continuous delivery takes continuous integration to the natural
next level.

Read this book. You'll see that we needn't endure the difficulties that
we take for granted when we maintain a software system.
